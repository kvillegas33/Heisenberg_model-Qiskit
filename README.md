# Quantum simulation of the Heisenberg model

## Overview
I wanted to learn about quantum computation and started with
this excercise. I was not very familiar about how to implement
a hand-written Hamiltonian to a quantum circuit so I went
step by step. At first, I dealt with the external magnetic field.
Then I added the nearest neighbor interaction tem. Finally, I
wrote down quantum circuit of a system of n-spins. Browsing
the literature I optimized for the number of CNOT gates and
the depth of the circuit.

## Jupyter Notebooks
'Heisenberg_model.ipynb' contains the step by step that I followed
to transform the Heisenberg hamiltonian into a quantum circuit.
Inside, you will find indications of the different steps I took
and the quantum circuit implemented in Qiskit.
